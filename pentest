CHALLENGE-3
1.Analyse the text file.
2.By Using Windings font translator which itself is a tool to convert it.
3.Therefore after converting it will get the output in the form of flag.

CHALLENGE-4
1.Analyse the data file.You are given with the enctrypted file and will have to decode it.
2.As given in the question that normal decoding would not help.
3.Similarly,decode the file sevaral times to get the exact flag.
4.For that we use python codeto decode it sevaral times
5.After several decoding process ,use XOR and ROT-13 decoding and then finally will get the flag.

CHALLENGE-5
1.Analyse the text file.
2.The text you provided is hexadecimal.
3.Therefore,using hexadecimal editor we can decrypt the text to get the flag.

REVERSING


CHALLENGE-2
1.Analyse the Pyc decompile.
2.After decompile the text using pyc decompiler,the result you will get will be a python code.
3.Run the python code.
4.Therefore will get the flag
